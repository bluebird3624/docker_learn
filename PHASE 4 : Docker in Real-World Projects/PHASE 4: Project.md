✅ PHASE 4: Docker in Real-World Projects
This phase is about hands-on, real developer work — using Docker daily in actual app environments.

Here's the full breakdown, and we’ll go step by step:

🔷 23. Dockerizing Web Apps (Node.js, Python, etc.)
🧠 Goal:
Take a web app (Node.js, Flask, Django, etc.) and turn it into a self-contained Docker image that runs anywhere.

🛠️ Example: Dockerizing a Node.js App
Project structure:

go
Copy
Edit
my-node-app/
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM node:20

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-node-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
Your app is now containerized.

Want a Python (Flask) example too?

🔷 24. Connecting Docker to Databases (Postgres, Redis, etc.)
🧠 Goal:
Link your app to a database container — locally and in development.

🛠️ With Docker Compose (Flask + Postgres):
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: "3.9"

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      DB_HOST: db
      DB_USER: postgres
      DB_PASSWORD: example
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
Now your Flask app connects to db:5432.

Same applies to Redis, Mongo, MySQL, etc.

🔷 25. Building for Production
🧠 Goal:
Build clean, minimal, secure images for production environments.

🔧 Use multi-stage builds:
Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Build
FROM node:20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Step 2: Serve
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
✅ Benefits:
Smaller image size

No source code or build tools

Faster deploys, fewer vulnerabilities

🔷 26. Using Docker with VSCode / IDEs
🧠 Goal:
Integrate Docker with your dev tools for a smooth workflow.

✅ VSCode Extensions:
Docker: manage containers, images, logs

Dev Containers (Remote - Containers): run VSCode inside a Docker container!

Create a .devcontainer/devcontainer.json:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Node Dev",
  "image": "node:20",
  "features": {},
  "mounts": [
    "source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/workspace,type=bind"
  ],
  "workspaceFolder": "/workspace"
}
This gives you a consistent, isolated dev environment for any project.

🔷 27. Debugging Inside Containers
🛠️ Tools:
docker exec -it <container> bash

docker logs <container>

docker inspect <container>

Add tools like curl, ping, htop, ps for debugging

You can also attach a debugger (e.g. VSCode remote debugging with Node or Python) by exposing debug ports and running the app in debug mode.

🔷 28. Creating a Local Dev Environment Using Docker Compose
🧠 Goal:
Replicate your full stack (frontend, backend, DB, Redis, etc.) locally with one command.

🔧 Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: "3.9"

services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      DB_HOST: db
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
Now run:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker compose up --build
Your entire app is running with one command, fully isolated.

I can walk you through setting up a real project:
✅ Dockerize it
✅ Connect it to a database
✅ Run it in dev and prod modes
✅ Push to Docker Hub
✅ Optionally deploy to Heroku or another platform
